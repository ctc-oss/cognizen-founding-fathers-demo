# Cognizen Demo
Just as the founding fathers of the United States created our democratic republic as we know it, Cognizen is democratizing content development. Like our democratic republic, everyone can participate and contribute in Cognizen, in order to form a more perfect curriculum.

The objective of this module is to showcase Cognizen’s capabilities while also showcasing the accomplishments of our nation’s founding fathers, and revealing some fun facts along the way.

Enjoy learning about Cognizen and our nation’s founders!
